# ToDo App using LocalStorage

This ToDo app is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app uses the browser's LocalStorage to persist tasks, ensuring that the tasks remain even after the user closes or refreshes the page.

## Features

- Add a new task: Users can add a new task by typing in the input field and pressing Enter or clicking the Add button.
- Mark task as completed: Users can mark a task as completed by clicking the checkbox next to the task.
- Delete a task: Users can delete a task by clicking the delete button next to the task.
- Tasks persist in LocalStorage: Tasks are saved in the browser's LocalStorage, so they remain even after the page is closed or refreshed.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
